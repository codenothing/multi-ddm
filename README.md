Bowser Support
--------------

**IE** 7, 8  
**FireFox** 2.0.0.20, 3.0.17, 3.5.7, 3.6  
**Safari** 3.0.4, 3.1.2, 3.2.1, 4.0.5

IE 6
----
Multi-ddm does function properly in IE6, the javascript itself works. It's a css problem that is causing this project
to drop support for IE6. I am very open to suggestions on how to fix this, but it seems that I am at a cross roads,
and a new version might bring more eyes to this problem.
