# New Features

-bgiframe options can be stored in the settings which will be passed to the bgiframe plugin
-bgiframe now only gets called on initialization, instead of on every mouseover
-Using jQuery's delegate instead of mouse events on every level/element

# Possible Breaks
-Removed jQuery.fn.reverse creation (Using native Array.prototype.reverse)
-Removed jQuery.fn.bgiframe creation (Uses the plugin if it's installed, but doesn't create the namespace)
-Removed dependency on numberOfLevels setting
